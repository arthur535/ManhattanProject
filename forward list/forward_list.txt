This is an implementation of forward linked list data structure with iterators.

Here you'll see member functions of Forward List
    clear()
    swap()
    front()
    empty()
    size()
    insert()
    erase()
    push_front()
    pop_front()
    sort() // Insertion Sort
    reverse()
    print()

Iteartor functions and operators
    begin()
    end()
    operator ++
    operator *
    operator ->
    
And also operators that can be used with Forward List
    operator = 
    operator == 
    operator != 
    operator < 
    operator > 
    operator <= 
    operator >= 

And what you need to use this data structure? 
- Just include "forward_list.h" file
