This is an implementation of adaptive container priority_queue using Vector (also self implemented).
Implementation is done using max heap data structure.

Here you'll see member functions of priority_queue
    insert()
    deletion()
    increase_key()
    excractMax()
    data()
    get_max()
    size()

And what you need to use this data structure? 
- Just include file in directory - "priority_queue.h"
